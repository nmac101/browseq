<p>browse? or browseq is a browser made using hh (HtmlHelp). This idea came to my head when I read somewhere you can use hh as a minimalistic browser (to download other browsers instead of using edge). It's extremely lightweight (11 KB). Note this only can show basic web pages or web pages from 2010 or earlier.</p>
